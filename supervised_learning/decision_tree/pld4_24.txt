Machine learning- provides the system with the ability to automatically learn and improve the experience

Patter Recognition
Facial identities or facial expressions
Handwritten or spoken words
Medical images
Sensor Data/ IoT( internet of things)

Anomaly Detection
Unusual sounds, sequences, patterns, etc.


Optimization: Many parameters have " hidden"  relationships that can be the basis of optimization

Pattern Generation

each column of the data set that we get is called a feature


What is learning: a procedure that consists of estimating the model parameters so that the
learned model ( algorithm) can perform a specific task
In artificial NEURAL Networks, these parameters are the weight matrix (w's)
y = ax + b  a and b are the parameters to learn

Given
-a dataset D,
- a task T, and
 - a performance measure M

 A computer system is sad to learn from D to perform task T if after  learning the system
 performance on T improves as measured by M

Data: Loan application Data
Task: Predict wheter a loan should be approved or not
Preformance measure: accuracy

No learning : clasify all future application ( test data)to the majority class (i.e., Yes)
 Accuracy 60%= 9/15 = 60%


 Types of learning

 Supervises  Learning: Data and corresponding lables are Given
 Unsupervised learning:  Only data is given ,no lables proivided
